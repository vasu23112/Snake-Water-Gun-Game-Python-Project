# Snake-Water-Gun-Game-Python-Project
What the project does
• The computer randomly picks one of three choices: 1 = Snake, -1 = Water, 0 = Gun
• The user inputs "s", "w", or "g"
• A dictionary (youdict) converts user input to a numeric value, and another (reversedict) converts back to names for printing
• The game compares the user’s and computer’s choices, then prints whether it's a win, loss, or draw along with a reason
